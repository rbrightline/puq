by seamlessly integrating validation and API documentation within a single decorator. These decorators ensure that database entities are not only mapped efficiently but also validated at the DTO level while providing clear API documentation using Swagger.\nDatabase entity development is streamlined through the integration of intuitive and widely adopted implementations within decorators. These decorators are paired with class-validator, class-transformer, and @nestjs/swagger, enhancing efficiency in the development process. This approach achieves a minimum reduction of 60% in both code volume and associated errors.\nInstall\nExample :  pnpm add @puq/ormSQLite\n\nSQLite does not support array or object data types. To accommodate this limitation, data must be transformed into a string format.\n\nPostgres Datasource\nTo optimize datasource performance, implement the following configuration settings:\n\npoolSize: Set to 50. This defines the maximum number of connections allowed in the pool, ensuring efficient resource utilization while accommodating peak demand.\nmin: Set to 10. This specifies the minimum number of connections maintained in the pool, keeping a baseline of readily available connections to reduce latency during low-traffic periods.\nmax: Set to 50. This establishes the upper limit of open connections, balancing system performance with resource availability to prevent overloading.\nidleTimeoutMillis: Configure to 30,000 milliseconds. This determines the duration an idle connection remains open before being closed, minimizing unnecessary resource consumption during periods of inactivity.\nconnectionTimeoutMillis: Configure to 2,000 milliseconds. This sets the maximum time allowed to establish a connection, enhancing application responsiveness by preventing prolonged delays.\n\nPostgres Server\nAdjust the PostgreSQL server configuration file (postgres.conf) with the following settings:\n\nmax_connections: Set to 200 to accommodate both application and administrative connections, ensuring sufficient capacity.\nshared_buffers: Allocate 25-40% of the server's RAM for optimal performance, configured to 4GB.\nwork_mem: Define the memory allocation per query or sort operation, set to 16MB to enhance query efficiency.\n\nNumbers\n\nThe number data type is stored as a string (numeric) to ensure the preservation of precision.\nThe number value is not converted to a JavaScript number to avoid disrupting query operations.\n\nTypeorm Column Transformer\n\nRefrain from using TypeORM column transformers, as they may interfere with query operations. Instead, implement transformations within the data transfer layer.\n\nHashing and encrypion\n\nHashing should be done in database layer. Typeorom column transformer is safe to use\nEncryption is done in controller layer\nFor handling encrypted data, implement a dedicated data transfer object (DTO) class and apply it subsequent to the execution of the initial DTO class within the controller\n\nFunding\nThank you for using @puq/orm It's an open-source project, and maintaining it takes time and effort.
