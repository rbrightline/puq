# @puq/rest

## Install

```bash
  pnpm add @puq/rest
```

## Summary

A powerful library designed to streamline the creation of RESTful APIs in NestJS by reducing boilerplate code and minimizing the risk of bugs. This library introduces custom decorators for Controllers and methods, automatically generating plural and singular resource paths, as well as handling complex relational routes. It is perfect for developers looking to speed up their development process, eliminate redundancy, and ensure consistency across API endpoints.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Path Generation**: Say goodbye to manually defining each API route. The library automatically creates both plural and singular resource paths, such as `/resources` and `/resource/:id`, with zero configuration required.
- **Relational Route Support**: Effortlessly define relational paths like `/resource/:id/:relatedName/:relatedId`, ensuring seamless handling of nested routes and related resources.

- **Custom Decorators**: Use intuitive and reusable decorators for both controllers and methods, significantly reducing the amount of code and improving readability and maintainability.

- **Standardized REST API Endpoints**: Get all the common REST API routes you need out-of-the-box, including `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more. This ensures consistency in API structure and reduces the chances of human error.

- **Bug Reduction**: By automating the routing logic and using predefined patterns, this library eliminates the potential for typos or incorrect path formats, making your API routes more reliable and easier to manage.

- **Scalable and Extensible**: Easily integrate this library into any existing NestJS project with minimal setup. Its flexible structure allows for future customization to meet specific use cases.

### Benefits

- **Faster Development**: With automatic path creation and simplified decorators, you can rapidly build and maintain APIs with less effort and fewer lines of code.
- **Improved Consistency**: Standardizing routes across your project helps ensure a consistent API structure, reducing confusion and increasing developer productivity.

- **Reduced Bugs**: Automated path generation and relational route handling drastically reduce human error, leading to more robust and maintainable APIs.

- **Cleaner Code**: Custom decorators reduce boilerplate code and allow developers to focus on the actual logic of the application rather than spending time on repetitive tasks.
