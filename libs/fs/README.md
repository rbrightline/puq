# @puq/fs

## Summary

The library restricts I/O operations to the project directory. These operations are confined within the defined scope and cannot access resources outside of it.

By default, the scope is set to the current working directory (cwd), meaning that functions are limited to accessing files and directories within this directory.

## Install

  pnpm add @puq/fs
```
